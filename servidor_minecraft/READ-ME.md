# How To Start / Run The Server

# Java 21 is required

1. Extract/Unarchive this server pack zip

2. Use the appropriate batch file:

## Linux

Run `.\start.sh` or `bash start.sh` to start the server.

## Windows

Run `start.bat`.
Do **not** delete the PowerShell (ps1) files!

## MacOS

Run `.\start.sh` or `bash start.sh` to start the server.

# Note!

Forge and NeoForge 1.17 and up will create run.bat/sh scripts due to the ServerStarterJar being used to install
and run the server. It is safe to ignore these and continue using the start.bat/sh scripts.
